You need to install Spike ISA simulator and Google's RISCV-DV.

Set the environment variables:

- UVMHOME: Root of UVM library (not necessary?)
- RISCV_DV_ROOT: Root of Google's RISCV-DV repository
- RISCV_GCC: path to your RISC-V gcc executable (ex: /opt/riscv/bin/riscv32-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc)
- SPIKE_PATH: path to your Spike directory (ex: /opt/riscv/bin)
